You can find the relevant data files at https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data. 
To use the code you should download the repository and unzip the contents of the data files to the /data diretory. 
This should include sessions.csv, test_users.csv, and train_users_2.csv. 
Per Kaggle guidelines, I cannot directly provide data files.
