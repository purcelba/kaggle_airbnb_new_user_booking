# Kaggle challenge | Airbnb New User Bookings


The Python code in this repository implements the data analysis and modeling used for the Kaggle Airbnb New User Bookings challenge.

Additionally, I used model-based analysis to understand which factors are most predictive about whether a new user would book a destination. 

You can find the relevant data files [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data).  To use the code you should download the repository and unzip the contents of the data files to the /data diretory.  This should include sessions.csv, test_users.csv, and train_users_2.csv).
