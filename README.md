# Kaggle challenge | Airbnb New User Bookings


The Python code in this repository implements the data analysis and modeling used for the Kaggle Airbnb New User Bookings challenge.  You can read about the analysis in detail in [my blog post](https://purcelba.github.io/Kaggle-airbnb/).  Briefly, the goal of this challenge was to predict which country a new Airbnb user's first booking destination will be based on a set of demographics and web session records. Additionally, I used model-based analysis to understand which factors are most predictive about whether a new user would book a destination. 

You can find the relevant data files [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/data).  To use the code you should download the repository and unzip the contents of the data files to the /data diretory.  This should include sessions.csv, test_users.csv, and train_users_2.csv).   

Two Jupyter notebooks outline the 


Feature engineering is handled by two functions:
- format_sessions.py, format the sessions data for subsequent modeling.  It generates indicator variables for each combination of action name, type, and detail to be joined with user demographic data. The resulting .csv files should be saved in the /data directory.
- feateng.py, returns a formatted feature matrix to be used for modeling.  It uses the .csv files generated by format_sessions.py if sessions data are requested.

Model fitting is handled by the following three functions:
- logregModel.py - fit a 
- kerasModel.py
- xgbModel.py
